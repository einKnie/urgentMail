# urgentMail
Sets the urgent flag on Thunderbird window upon incoming mail.

By default, only the inbox of every active mail account is monitored for incoming mail, though any and all of folders can be selected via the settings.

[WIP]

## Installation

To install as a temporary Thunderbird extension:

1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. In Thunderbird, navigate to the add-ons page
3. Click on the gear icon on the top right side and select __Debug Addons__
4. In the dialog, navigate to the cloned repo and open any file in the _urgentMail_ directory - e.g. _manifest.json_.

The extension is now installed and active.

## Usage
Just activate the add-on and Thunderbird will draw attention to itself on incoming mail.  
This will let your window manager know that there is something going on in the respective workspace.
