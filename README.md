# urgentMail

Sets the urgent flag on Thunderbird window upon incoming mail.

Per default, the Add-on monitors every account's Inbox, though you can decide which folders to monitor in the Add-on's settings.


## Installation

#### The Easy Way
 
[Get it on the Thunderbird Addons Page](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-GB/thunderbird/addon/urgentmail/)

---

##### Old Install Instructions

To install as a temporary Thunderbird extension:

1. Clone this repo to your machine
2. In Thunderbird, navigate to the add-ons page
3. Click on the gear icon on the top right side and select __Debug Addons__
4. Select __Load Temporary Addon__ and in the dialog, navigate to the cloned repo and open any file in the _urgentMail_ directory - e.g. _manifest.json_.

The extension is now installed and active.

## Usage

Just activate the add-on and Thunderbird will draw attention to itself on incoming mail.  
This will let your window manager know that there is something going on in the respective workspace.
